/**
 * klvSigner.js
 *
 * Talks to the KLV Signer app: a separate Android app that holds a Klever
 * wallet's private key and signs transactions for other apps, after the
 * user approves each one with their password there. This app
 * never sees the key - it only sends an unsigned transaction and gets back
 * either a signature or a "no".
 *
 * How it works: Android's "start an activity for result" (via
 * expo-intent-launcher). Android tells the Signer which app is asking and
 * hands the answer back only to us. The exact rules are the Signer's own
 * SIGNER-PROTOCOL.md (in the KLV Signer project); this file follows it.
 *
 * Two things we can ask:
 *   getSignerAddress()          -> which wallet is in the Signer (klv1...)
 *   signWithSigner(unsignedHex) -> { signedTransaction, transactionHash, ... }
 *
 * Both throw an Error with a plain-English `message` and a `code` when the
 * answer is "no" (e.g. code 'USER_REJECTED' when the user tapped Reject,
 * 'NOT_INSTALLED' if the Signer app isn't on the phone).
 *
 * Android 11+ only lets us talk to the Signer because app.json lists it
 * under <queries> - see plugins/withKlvSigner.js.
 *
 * Before EVERY request this app checks the Signer's seal (its signing
 * certificate) with Android: only the official KLV Signer gets the request.
 * A fake app installed under the Signer's name would carry another seal and
 * gets nothing (error code 'SIGNER_NOT_OFFICIAL'). If the check can't run,
 * nothing is sent either ('SIGNER_CHECK_FAILED'). SIGNER-PROTOCOL.md 2c;
 * the native part is modules/klv-signer-check.
